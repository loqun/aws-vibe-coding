## Technical Decisions Requiring Clarification

1. **Time Slot Intervals**: User stories mention 1-hour intervals, but logical design shows hourly slots. Should we support custom durations or fixed 1-hour bookings?

2. **Payment Integration**: Should we use Stripe Checkout (redirect) or Stripe Elements (embedded)? Elements provides better UX but requires more implementation.

3. **Offline Functionality**: How much offline capability is needed? Basic caching or full offline booking capability?

4. **Multi-language Support**: Is internationalization required for the initial version?

5. **Analytics Integration**: Should we integrate Google Analytics or similar for user behavior tracking?

6. **Email Integration**: Should email confirmations be handled by frontend (via email service) or backend?

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- Backend APIs will be available as per functional specification
- Stripe account and API keys will be provided
- Design system/brand guidelines will be provided or we'll use a clean, professional design
- SSL certificate will be configured for production deployment
- CORS will be properly configured on backend services
