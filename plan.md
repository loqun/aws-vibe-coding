# Implementation Plan for Customer Booking Unit

## Overview
Implementing a highly scalable, event-driven system for the Customer Booking unit based on the Domain Driven Design logical design. This will be a simplified Python implementation with in-memory repositories and event stores.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
- [x] **Step 1.1**: Create the directory structure for `/construction/customer_booking/src/`
- [x] **Step 1.2**: Set up the basic project files (requirements.txt, __init__.py files)

### Phase 2: Domain Layer Implementation
- [x] **Step 2.1**: Implement Value Objects (CustomerInfo, ChildInfo, Money, etc.)
- [x] **Step 2.2**: Implement Domain Events (BookingCreated, PaymentProcessed, BookingCancelled)
- [x] **Step 2.3**: Implement Entities (Booking, Franchise, Payment)
- [x] **Step 2.4**: Implement Aggregates (BookingAggregate)
- [x] **Step 2.5**: Implement Domain Services (PricingService, AvailabilityService)

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer Implementation
- [x] **Step 3.1**: Implement in-memory repositories (BookingRepository, FranchiseRepository, PaymentRepository)
- [x] **Step 3.2**: Implement in-memory event store (EventStore)
- [x] **Step 3.3**: Implement event publisher (EventPublisher)

### Phase 4: Application Layer Implementation
- [x] **Step 4.1**: Implement Application Services (BookingApplicationService)
- [x] **Step 4.2**: Simplified - Combined command/query handling in application service
- [x] **Step 4.3**: Simplified - Combined command/query handling in application service

### Phase 5: API Layer Implementation
- [x] **Step 5.1**: Implement FastAPI application setup and configuration
- [x] **Step 5.2**: Implement REST API endpoints for booking operations
- [x] **Step 5.3**: Implement REST API endpoints for availability operations
- [x] **Step 5.4**: Implement REST API endpoints for payment operations

### Phase 6: Demo and Testing
- [x] **Step 6.1**: Create demo script with sample data and test scenarios
- [x] **Step 6.2**: Test all booking workflows (create, modify, cancel, payment)
- [x] **Step 6.3**: Test availability checking and franchise operations
- [x] **Step 6.4**: Verify event publishing and handling

### Phase 7: Documentation and Finalization
- [x] **Step 7.1**: Create README.md with setup and usage instructions
- [x] **Step 7.2**: Test API server startup
- [x] **Step 7.3**: Final testing and validation

## Decisions Made

**Value Objects**: Implementing core ones from logical design (Money, CustomerInfo, ChildInfo)
**External Services**: Using mock implementations for Stripe, S3, SQS
**Test Scenarios**: Basic booking workflow (create → pay → cancel)
**Security**: Skipping authentication for demo simplicity

## Technical Decisions Made
- Using Python with FastAPI as specified in the logical design
- Implementing simplified in-memory versions of PostgreSQL and Redis
- Creating mock implementations for external services (Stripe, S3, SQS)
- Following the exact directory structure proposed in the logical design
- Implementing minimal but functional versions of all components
